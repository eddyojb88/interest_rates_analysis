# Jupyter Notebook: Interest Rates vs Inflation (CPI)

I assume that the user is familiar in Python and in how to load Jupyter.

If using a virtual environment, such as venv or conda, you can use the requirements.txt file to load relevant Python modules.

## Docker

For those familiar with Docker, there is a Dockerfile and compose file that can be run via 'docker compose up'
It's a big Dockerfile but I usually find slim python docker images  useless as soon as I want to install something slightly off piste.

# Datasets

For convenience, I have uploaded the BIS reference table in the bis_data folder. However, other supplementary dataests, such as the inflation (CPI) and central policy rate data were too big to upload if wanting to look at all countries. Therefore, I have provided the source links inline within the Jupyter notebook where you can select and download yourself.
